## Views
to create a page for example **User**, u have two choices.
1. domain.com/home/user
2. domain.com/user
	- u can use a `area` if we think need **user** will need its own isolated sets of views.
	- you can create your views and controllers in the default folders outside the Areas folder.if you don't anticipate the need for separate sets of views that are isolated within specific functional areas,
